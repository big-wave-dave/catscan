A port scanner to learn some of the concepts. There's not much to it, it scans all the named ports provided by an NMAP file and then scans every port, named or not. There's no additional functionality, but I plan on adding ranges of ports to be scanned, updating the UI, and adding support for additional protocols and TCP flags.
